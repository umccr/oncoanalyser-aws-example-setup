# Create Starting Account

The first step is to create a root AWS account that is used to manage the organization.

#### Create a new AWS account

Follow the signup link at
[https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register)

#### Specify a root email and username

This email should be that of a mailing list shared amongst overall organisation administrators.

#### Verify the email address

#### Create a password

This should obviously be a very strong password and be recorded securely somewhere. There is an opportunity to add an
MFA device to this login.

This email/password combination is almost never needed in day to day operation in AWS - it is purely for asserting
ownership of the entire organisation. It is needed for this initial setup phase though.

One long term technique that is possible is to _not_ record the password anywhere - and require a password reset flow to
be executed whenever staff need to login via this login (see above re: the email address here should only be accessible
to overall organisation administrators).
